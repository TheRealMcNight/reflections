When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You should use a remote repository when you are collaborating with others on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By pulling manually you get more control of if you want to pull the most up to date version of the codes or not. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

  You would use a fork if you wanted to modify someone else's repo, but they do not want to show it on there repository. You would clone a repo if you wanted to work on a project locally. You would work on a branch if you are working in a group and want to make changes like adding new features.
  
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

  This will help deflect any conflicting merges.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

  You'll probably need a cloud server or be in the same room. I'm assuming it would be harder to collaborate in general, but it will be more secure since you are 
  sharing all your code to the public.
