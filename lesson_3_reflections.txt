When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  You should use a remote repository when you are collaborating with others on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  By pulling manually you get more control of if you want to pull the most up to date version of the codes or not.
